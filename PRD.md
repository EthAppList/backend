# PRD.md - Product Revision System Implementation

## Overview
This PRD outlines the implementation of a git-style product history system for the EthAppList backend. The system allows tracking all changes to products with detailed revision history, comparison capabilities, and revert functionality.

- ✅ Implement basic field change tracking
- ⚠️ Add edit categories (major/minor edit flags) - basic structure in place
- ⚠️ Implement edit conflict detection (not implemented)
- ⚠️ Add ability to mark edits as "minor" - field exists but not fully utilized
- ⚠️ Create edit templates/suggestions (not implemented)

### 📋 REMAINING IMPLEMENTATION ITEMS

- ❌ Edit approval workflows for sensitive fields
- ❌ Branching and merging for collaborative editing
- ❌ Export revision history to external formats

## Core Implementation Summary

### Database Schema
The revision system uses three main tables:
1. `product_revisions` - Stores complete product snapshots and metadata
2. `product_field_changes` - Tracks individual field changes between revisions  
3. Updated `products` table with `current_revision_number` and `last_editor_id` fields

### API Endpoints Summary
- **History**: `GET /api/products/{id}/history` - Browse edit history
- **Revisions**: `GET /api/products/{id}/revisions/{revision}` - View specific revision
- **Compare**: `GET /api/products/{id}/compare/{rev1}/{rev2}` - Compare two revisions
- **Revert**: `POST /api/products/{id}/revert/{revision}` - Revert to previous version (admin)
- **Update**: `PUT /api/products/{id}` - Direct update with edit summary
- **Recent**: `GET /api/recent-edits` - Activity feed of recent changes

### Key Features Implemented
✅ **Complete revision tracking** - Every product change creates a new revision
✅ **Field-level change detection** - Track exactly what changed between versions
✅ **Edit summaries** - Required explanations for all changes  
✅ **Comparison system** - Compare any two revisions side-by-side
✅ **Revert capability** - Admin can restore previous versions
✅ **Activity feeds** - Track recent edits across all products
✅ **Editor attribution** - Track who made each change
✅ **Performance optimized** - Proper indexing and pagination

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. **Rate Limiting**: Add middleware to prevent edit spam
2. **Conflict Detection**: Check for concurrent edits before applying changes  
3. **Minor Edit Utilization**: Fully implement minor edit flags and filtering
4. **Auto-summary Generation**: Generate summaries for simple changes
5. **Enhanced Admin Controls**: More granular permissions for different edit types
6. **Frontend Integration**: Build UI components for revision browsing and comparison

The core revision system is **fully functional** and ready for production use. The remaining items are enhancements that can be added iteratively based on user feedback and needs.
